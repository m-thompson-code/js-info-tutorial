    Hello world

    <script>
        let name = "John";
        const admin = name;
        alert(admin);// "John"

        // Example expects 'ourPlanetName'
        // This is alright, but I don't think we need to specify 'our' unless we are working with more than one planet
        const planetName = 'Earth';
        // Example expects currentUserName, but that assumes visitors have a user name (maybe they just have uid)
        let currentVisitor;

        const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982';// This is expected use of UpperCase as 'BIRTHDAY' is more readable than its value
        const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY);// I wouldn't use UpperCase here since we are assign this variable to the output of a function
