// 'use strict';

// let str = "Hello";

// str.test = 5; // (*)

// alert(str.test); // What happens?

// // I thought that this would result in an error no matter what, but this will only error on strict mode

// // If you're not in strict mode, the temporary primative constructor is called and created an object
// // Then that object's property test is added, but because the object is only temporary, this effectively does nothing
// // the alert will be undefined
